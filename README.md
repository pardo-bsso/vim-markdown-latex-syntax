# Markdown + LaTeX syntax for Vim

From time to time I write things in markdown that have LaTeX math notation that is picked up later by Pandoc or Mathjax
and having syntax support for that is quite helpful.

Put markdown.vim into ~/.vim/syntax and the $$ $$ and $ $ environments will be highlighted as LaTeX
